# Baneborne Origin - Origins (Fabric) For Minecraft 1.18
The Baneborne is a simple Origin, it takes the idea from Discord user Umbur#8401 which they posted on the Origin's Discord server. So all credits to them for the idea!

Baneborne datapack is made for the fabric mod, [Origins](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins). You must have it for this pack to work.

**This Pack Adds:**
- Custom Origin

**Origin Detail:**

Icon: Mossy Cobblestone <br />
Impact: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ <br />
Description: Widely seen as a figure representing death, the Baneborne haunts the areas marked by death and suffering.

*Positive ðŸŸ¢:*

- **Leap:** You can leap forward into the air allowing you to launch any nearby players into the air. (20 second cooldown) (Primary)
- **Cursing Beam:** Sends a black and white firework beam at the target, and if it hits it gives them Wither III, for 7 seconds. (25 second cooldown) (Secondary)
- **Remember:** You feel at home while exposed to moonlight so when you are, you get Slow Falling, Jump Boost II, and Regeneration II.
- **Otherworldly Love:** When wearing full Netherite Armor, you get Resistance I.
- **Quick On Your Feet:** You dodge all forms of projectiles.

*Neutral ðŸŸ¡:*

- **Hollow:** Your skin is slightly transparent.
- **Not Alone:** If you die it causes an explosion the tries to take the person that killed you down as well.

*Negative ðŸ”´:*

- **Death Itself:** Because you represent death you only have 8 hearts.
- **Chionophobia:** You are afraid of snow, so when in Powder Snow you can't leap out, get Slowness V, and get Blindness. You will also get Nausea in cold biomes.
- **Undead:** You take more damage from Smite.
